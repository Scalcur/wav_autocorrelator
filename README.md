wav_autocorrelator

## My university individual homework 

This python program was developed by me because I wanted to test my skills and wanted to combine tkinter and matplotlib in one app.
The application can graphically show you wav-audio and autocorrelate it in two ways: with librosa.autocorrelate func and loop func.

- You can set the lag values for different autocorrelation graphs by pressing <Set lag value>-BUTTON or <ENTER>
- You can choose different wav-files in file menu.
