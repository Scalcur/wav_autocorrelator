wav_autocorrelator

## My university individual homework 

This python program was developed by me because I wanted to test my skills and wanted to combine tkinter and matplotlib in one app.
The application can graphically show you wav-audio and autocorrelate it in two ways: with librosa.autocorrelate func and loop func.
